## Git commands
The following is a guide to get your source code set up using git.

### Getting started - Cloning the repository

Prepare Git to work with our ssl certificates (VERY IMPORTANT!):
```
git config --global http.sslVerify false
```
In order to clone the repository through our firewall, you will need to use HTTPS rather than SSH:
![httpNotSsh](/images/httpsNotSSH.png)

**Run the command**

`git clone <https_repo_url>`

```
Get the URL from the `Project` page (link on the left at the top).
NOTE: You will need to use the HTTPS url rather than the GIT protocol.
```

### Completing the exercise - Give back your code


**Commit your code locally by running the command**  
`git add --all`  
then  
`git commit -m "Coding exercise complete."`  

**Push your code to the remote server**
**Run the command**  
`git push`

`You will be prompted for your user name and credentials`
