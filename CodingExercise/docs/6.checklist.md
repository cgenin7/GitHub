## Checklist

Before you submit your coding exercise, please review the following checklist:

* Have you used Nuget to import your external libraries?
* Have you completed the technical skill self-assessment?

If you have answered yes to all these questions and you are confident in your implementation of the Sales Taxes coding exercise, you are now ready to submit your code for review.

Don't forget to call your recruiter to inform him or her that you've completed the exercise.

Thank you and good luck!
