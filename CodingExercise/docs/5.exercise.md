## Sales Taxes 

### Business Rules
The following are the main business rules of the coding exercise.

1. Basic sales tax is applicable at a rate of 10% on all goods **except**
  - Food
  - Book
  - Medical
2. Import duty is applicable at a rate of 5% on all goods, with no exemptions
3. When I purchase items, I receive a receipt which lists the name of all the items and their price(including tax). It also includes the total cost of the items and the total amounts of sales taxes paid. The rounding rules for sales tax are that for a tax rate of n%, a shelf price of p contains (np/100 rounded up to 2 decimal places) amount of sales tax.

### Exercise
Write an application that prints out the receipt details for these three shopping baskets


```
Basket 1                 |  Basket 2                               |  Basket 3
1 book at 12.49          |  1 imported box of chocolates at 10.00  |  1 imported bottle of perfume at 27.99
1 music CD at 14.99      |  1 imported bottle of perfume at 47.50  |  1 bottle of perfume at 18.99
1 chocolate bar at 0.85  |                                         |  1 packet of headache pills at 9.75
                         |                                         |  1 box of imported chocolates at 11.25
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Receipt 1                |  Receipt 2                              |  Receipt 3
1 book : 12.49           |  1 imported box of chocolates: 10.50    |  1 imported bottle of perfume: 32.19
1 music CD: 16.49        |  1 imported bottle of perfume: 54.63    |  1 bottle of perfume: 20.89
1 chocolate bar: 0.85    |  Sales Taxes: 7.63                      |  1 packet of headache pills: 9.75
Sales Taxes: 1.50        |  Total: 65.13                           |  1 imported box of chocolates: 11.81
Total: 29.83             |                                         |  Sales Taxes: 6.66
                         |                                         |  Total: 74.64
```


### Validation

As previously mentioned, validation will concern itself most on the following points:
* Consistency in coding style and object oriented practices
* High code coverage with unit tests


It is **not** important that you complete the exercise. We are far more interested in evaluating your clean code standards.

```
To be clear, completing the exercise with no automated testing and poor quality standards is viewed as unacceptable.
